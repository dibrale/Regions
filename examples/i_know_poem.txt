I know too little of the past
The many vagaries and intricate expressions
The hidden truths and overt misperceptions
Smoothed over by the years and put away at last
The house of memory is small
I cannot hope to keep them all
And neither can the palace of all human recollections
Become a proper home for histories so vast

I know too little of the now
Which faces must be worn to carry my intentions
And which to use to hide my knowing indiscretions
What sequences of gestures would endow
Reprieve from half the twisting agony
I know so well, yet others do not see
Or how to dowse for cracks and for exceptions
That would refreshing wind and breath allow

And therefore I know nothing of that which is to be
How leaves will fall, and with them all pretentions
Exposing in the nude the branches of conventions
As bars against the sun upon a beetle-eaten tree
And how the windswept snow will come
With welcome cold to make awareness numb
A glittering carpet stretched in all directions
Reflecting sound and sun to echo silence...

... Of eternity
