### Literature Commentary Demo

This demo is intended to demonstrate how the system can be used to generate a literary commentary on a poem. The structure includes:

  - 5x Region instances
  - 1x RAGRegion instance
  - 1x ListenerRegion instance

The system runs in seven execution layers for two rounds of analysis. No messages are cleared from Region instance reply buffers between rounds.
The ListenerRegion will open a GUI to snoop on communications. Make sure to set your server details below.
If the execution plan is not suitable for your setup, import 'lit_demo_state.json' via the GUI and adjust these to your liking.
There are additional code blocks below that can be substituted in to run the 'Commentate' region alone to compare with one-shot output.
Huge thanks to Bardic Mechanism for providing human-written text that is both conceptually challenging and unlikely to be represented in training data.
Poetry and songbook database are copyright Bardic Mechanism and used with permission.
