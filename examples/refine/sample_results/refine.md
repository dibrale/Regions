## Output

The origins of Western views on revenge reflect a profound **moral and institutional evolution**—shifting from *sanctioned retribution* to *moral condemnation*—driven by legal, religious, and philosophical forces over millennia. This transformation was neither linear nor inevitable but a hard-won cultural revolution. Below is a synthesized analysis of key phases, integrating the most salient insights from both sources:

### **Core Evolutionary Trajectory**  
| **Era**                | **View of Revenge**                          | **Key Catalysts**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ancient Near East**  | Legitimized as societal norm (*lex talionis*) | Hammurabi’s Code (c. 1754 BCE): "Eye for eye" standardized vengeance to *limit* blood feuds. |
| **Hebrew Bible**       | Mixed: *Lex talionis* + early critique      | Exodus 21:24 (proportional justice) **vs.** Amos 5:24/Micah 6:8 (mercy over vengeance); Deuteronomy 32:35 ("Vengeance is mine") shifted blame to God. |
| **Greek Philosophy**   | Critiqued as irrational (not justice)       | Aristotle (*Nicomachean Ethics*): Revenge = "a form of injustice" (seeks *more* than proportional harm). Stoics (Seneca): Vengeance = "foolish passion" enslaving the avenger. |
| **Roman Law**          | Replaced by state authority                 | *Twelve Tables* (451 BCE): Abandoned *lex talionis*; *Lex Aquilia* (286 BCE) imposed monetary fines. Cicero: "Revenge is irrational and destructive." |
| **Christianity**       | **Radical rejection** (personal revenge = sin) | *Sermon on the Mount* (Matt. 5:38–44): "Do not resist evil... turn the other cheek." Augustine: State punishment = divine order; *personal* revenge = "the devil’s work." |
| **Medieval–Early Modern** | Blood feuds banned; state as sole arbiter    | *Truce of God* (10th c.): Banned private vengeance. *Canon Law* (12th c.): Criminalized revenge as sin. *Magna Carta* (1215): Enshrined due process over vengeance. |
| **Enlightenment**      | Vengeance = barbaric; justice = rational      | Hobbes (*Leviathan*): State prevents "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish" life. Locke: Justice protects rights, not personal wrath. Bentham/Mill: Punishment must serve *societal well-being*, not catharsis. |

### **Why This Shift Matters**  
1. **Cultural Legacy**:  
   - Western law now prioritizes **restorative justice** (rehabilitation, reconciliation) over vengeance. The phrase "an eye for an eye" is now a *critique* of brutality (e.g., Gandhi’s use of it).  
   - **Contrast with other traditions**: Unlike Hindu *karma*, Islamic *qisas* (with forgiveness encouraged), or Maori *utu*, Western thought uniquely *rejected revenge as a moral good*.  

2. **Modern Tensions**:  
   - Despite legal codification, revenge persists in culture (e.g., *John Wick* films, "honor killings")—reflecting the **ongoing struggle** between ancient instincts and modern ethics.  
   - Psychology (e.g., Heider, 1958) frames revenge as *pathological*, reinforcing its moral disapproval.  

3. **The Unfinished Revolution**:  
   - The shift from **sacred duty** (Homeric Greece) to **moral sin** (Christianity) to **legal impossibility** (modern state systems) was driven by **religion, philosophy, and centralized governance**. As William James noted (1890), the human craving for "appreciation" now fuels *mercy*, not *retribution*.

### **Key Takeaway**  
Western views on revenge evolved through a **gradual moral revolution**—not a sudden break. Ancient codes *normalized* vengeance; Greek philosophy *questioned* it; Christianity *condemned* it as sin; and Enlightenment law *systematically eradicated* it. This journey reveals a core truth: **Western ethics now define virtue not through vengeance, but through forgiveness**. As DraftB’s analysis concludes, this was "a hard-won cultural transformation," where the state’s role in justice became the bedrock of modern civilization.
